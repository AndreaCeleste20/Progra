### YOUTUBE VIDEO, LINK TO THE CODE AND INSTRUCTIONS ###

Sample video: https://youtu.be/FdsRh2jfXFI

HERE IS A LINK TO THE CODE IN CASE YOU WANT TO TRY IT: https://onlinegdb.com/844_Js-cB
Or copy and paste each of the files in onlinegdb, remember each one has to have the same name than here.

### Why do this? ###

This is a program that will do the breakeven of a commerce. This helps to new commerces, it can be a little difficult to new commerces know how many portions they have to sold to cover all the expenses they have, this include the salarie.

### How does it work? ###

This program have subroutines, the types of files that includes is .h and .c.
In this project I tried to make a subroutine in a way we can just change some 
word and it works for all the parts of the program, in this way it will be easier to program because it will follow a sequence.

File            | Function
----------------|----------------------------------------------------------
Datos.h         | There are variables that will be needed in different files.
Operaciones.h   | There is the name of the action register, in this way, it can be called in any other file.
Operaciones.c   | All the structure of the action register.
Action REGISTER | It will changes some words dependings on what the program need to ask and register all the datas.
